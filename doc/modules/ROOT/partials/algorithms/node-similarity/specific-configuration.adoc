| similarityCutoff | Float | 1e-42 | yes | Lower limit for the similarity score to be present in the result.
Values must be between 0 and 1.
| degreeCutoff | Integer | 1 | yes | Inclusive lower bound on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.
| upperDegreeCutoff | Integer | 2147483647 | yes | Inclusive upper bound on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.
| topK | Integer | 10 | yes | Limit on the number of scores per node.
The K largest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| bottomK | Integer | 10 | yes | Limit on the number of scores per node.
The K smallest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| topN | Integer | 0 | yes | Global limit on the number of scores computed.
The N largest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| bottomN | Integer | 0 | yes | Global limit on the number of scores computed.
The N smallest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty] | String | null | yes | Name of the relationship property to use as weights.
If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| similarityMetric | String | JACCARD | yes | The metric used to compute similarity.
Can be either `JACCARD`, `OVERLAP` or `COSINE`.
|  useComponents | Boolean or String | false | yes | If enabled, Node Similarity will use components to improve the performance of the computation, skipping comparisons of nodes in different components.
Set to `false` (Default): the algorithm does not use components, but computes similarity across the entire graph.
Set to `true`: the algorithm uses components, and will compute these components before computing similarity.
Set to *String*: use pre-computed components stored in graph, *String* is the key for a node property representing components.
