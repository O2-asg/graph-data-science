== Introduction

A topological sorting of nodes in a graph is an ordering of the nodes in the graph where every node appears only after all the nodes pointing to it have appeared.
For example, for a graph with 4 nodes and these relations: `a->b`, `a->c`, `b->d`, `c->d`, there are two acceptable topological sorts: `a, b, c, d` and `a, c, b, d`.

The topological order of the nodes is defined only for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
See xref:#topological-sort-cycles[below] for the expected result for graphs with cycles.

GDS provides an efficient parallel implementation for this algorithm.


[[topological-sort-cycles]]
=== Cycles

Running the algorithm on a graph with cycles will cause the omitting of part of the nodes from the sorting.
 The omitted nodes are:

1. Nodes that are part of a cycle (including self cycles)

2. Nodes that are dependent on a cycle. It means nodes that are reachable from another node which is part of a cycle

All the other nodes in the graph will be ordered in a valid topological order.

For example, in the following graph only node 0 will be part of the sorting.
Nodes 1 and 2 are part of a cycle, therefore will be excluded from the sorting.
Node 3 is reachable from node 1, which is part of a cycle, therefore it will also be excluded.

=== Usage

Topological ordering of the nodes is beneficial when you want to guarantee a node will only be processed after its dependencies were processed.
This is very useful for dependency related tasks such as scheduling or calculations that derive values from their dependencies.


==== Cycles detection

The algorithm can also be used to determine if the graph contains a cycle or not.
If all the nodes in the graph appear in the sorting, there is no cycle in the graph.
If some of the nodes are missing from the sorting, there is a cycle.
It does not tell which nodes constitute the cycle, but it does give a clue, as described in the xref:#topological-sort-cycles[cycles] section.


==== Maximum distance from source

In addition to the sorted node IDs, the algorithm can return the maximal distance of a noe from any source node (i.e., a node without any incoming relationships).
If you are interested at the actual longest paths, you should look into the xref:algorithms/dag/longest-path.adoc[longest path] algorithm instead.

In the case that nodes model tasks with dependencies between them,  knowing maximal distances can help schedule tasks more efficient:
If two nodes have the same maximal distance from a source, then they have no dependencies between them, and can be scheduled in parallel.

To use this feature set `computeMaxDistanceFromSource` to true.
Note that this comes with higher memory usage and slightly longer run time.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: Topological Sort
:graph-description: supply chain
:image-file: dependencies.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
       (n0:Part {name: 'Cement'}),
       (n1:Part {name: 'Base'}),
       (n2:Part {name: 'Skeleton'}),
       (n3:Part {name: 'Steel'}),
       (n4:Part {name: 'Support'}),
       (n5:Part {name: 'Door'}),
       (n6:Part {name: 'House'}),

       (n0)-[:REQUIRED]->(n1),
       (n1)-[:REQUIRED]->(n2),
       (n3)-[:REQUIRED]->(n4),
       (n4)-[:REQUIRED]->(n2),
       (n2)-[:REQUIRED]->(n5),
       (n5)-[:REQUIRED]->(n6)
----

This graph describes a simplified supply chain of building a house.
Each part of the house cannot be worked on before its requirements are met.
For example, we cannot build support before getting the steel, the skeleton is not ready until both support and base are ready.

.The following Cypher statement will project the graph to GDS:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
MATCH (n)
OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r:REQUIRED]->(target)
RETURN gds.graph.project("g", n, target, {})
----


=== Stream

The stream procedure streams the nodes in the graph ordered by a valid topological order.
The nodes can then be processed one by one, guaranteeing that each node is processed only after its dependencies were processed.

For more details on the stream mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stream[Stream].

.The following will run the Topological Sort algorithm in `stream` mode with max distance from source feature enabled.
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.dag.topologicalSort.stream("g", {computeMaxDistanceFromSource: true})
YIELD nodeId, maxDistanceFromSource
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, maxDistanceFromSource
ORDER BY maxDistanceFromSource, name
----

We use the utility function `asNode` to return the name of node instead of its ID to make results more readable.
