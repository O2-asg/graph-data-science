= Native projection
:description: This section details projecting GDS graphs using `native` projections.
:page-aliases: management-ops/projections/graph-project.adoc


Native projections are the easiest way to create a xref:management-ops/index.adoc[GDS graph] from a Neo4j database.
A native projection is entirely described by configuration parameters.

_Node projections_ and _relationship projections_ describe the way nodes and relationships are loaded (_projected_) from the database into the in-memory graph.
While node projections are based on node labels, relationship projections are based on relationship types.
Both can include properties.


== Considerations

=== Lifecycle

Projected graphs reside in memory (in the graph catalog) until any of the following happens:

- The graph is dropped with the xref:management-ops/graph-drop.adoc[`gds.graph.drop`] procedure.
- The Neo4j database from which the graph was projected is stopped or dropped.
- The Neo4j DBMS is stopped.


=== Node property support

Native projections can only project a limited set of node property types from the Neo4j database.
The xref:management-ops/graph-creation/index.adoc#node-properties-supported[Node Properties page] details which node property types are supported.
Other types of node properties have to be transformed or encoded into one of the supported types in order to be projected using a native projection.

[[node-projection-syntax]]
=== Node projection

A node projection can be specified using any of the following forms:

* A single string (either a Neo4j node label `<label>` or a wildcard `*`)
* A list of Neo4j node labels (`[<label_1>, <label_2>, <label_3>]`)
* A projection map, where each key is a node label in the projected graph and each value is itself a map

The projection map is specified as follows:

----
{
    <projected_label_1>: {                       <1>
        label: <label_1>,                        <2>
        properties: <prop_1>                     <3>
    },
    <projected_label_2>: {
        label: <label_2>,
        properties: [<prop_1>, <prop_2>, ...]    <3>
    },
    <projected_label_3>: {
        label: <label_3>,
        properties: {                            <3>
            <projected_prop_1>: {                <4>
                property: <prop_1>,              <5>
                defaultValue: <default_1>        <6>
            },
            <projected_prop_2>: {
                property: <prop_2>,
                defaultValue: <default_2>
            },
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
----
<1> Node label to create in the projected graph. It can be the same as the corresponding Neo4j node label.
<2> Source Neo4j node label as a string. Default: same as the projected label (`<projected_label_1>` here).
<3> Node property projection, specified as a single Neo4j node property, a list of Neo4j node properties, or a projection map. Default: empty map.
<4> Node property to create in the projected graph. It can be the same as the corresponding Neo4j node property.
<5> Source Neo4j node property as a string. Default: same as the projected property name (`<projected_prop_1>` here).
<6> Default value if the property is not defined for a node. Default: a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/index.adoc#node-properties-supported[fallback value] depending on the property type.

==== Notes

* When specified as a string or a list, the projection does not include any node properties.

* The wildcard form does not retain the labels on the projected nodes.
Node labels are useful with algorithms that fully support xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-traits[heterogeneous nodes].
The <<all-labels-example>> example shows how to retain all the labels for these cases.

* All nodes with _any_ of the specified node labels are projected into the GDS graph.

* All specified node labels and properties must exist in the database.
You can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/#procedure_db_createproperty[`db.createProperty()`] procedure to create a new node property without modifying the database.


[[relationship-projection-syntax]]
=== Relationship projection

A Relationship projection can be specified using any of the following forms:

* A single string (either a Neo4j relationship type `<type>` or a wildcard `*`)
* A list of Neo4j relationship types (`[<type_1>, <type_2>, <type_3>]`)
* A projection map, where each key is a relationship type in the projected graph and each value is itself a map

The projection map is specified as follows:

----
{
    <projected_type_1>: {                        <1>
        type: <type_1>,                          <2>
        orientation: <orientation_1>,            <3>
        aggregation: <aggregation_1>,            <4>
        properties: <prop_1>                     <5>
    },
    <projected_type_2>: {
        type: <type_2>,
        orientation: <orientation_2>,
        aggregation: <aggregation_2>,
        properties: [<prop_1>, <prop_2>, ...]    <5>
    },
    <projected_type_3>: {
        type: <type_3>,
        orientation: <orientation_3>,
        aggregation: <aggregation_3>,
        properties: {                            <5>
            <projected_prop_1>: {                <6>
                property: <prop_1>,              <7>
                defaultValue: <default_1>,       <8>
                aggregation: <aggregation_1>     <9>
            },
            <projected_prop_2>: {
                property: <prop_2>,
                defaultValue: <default_2>,
                aggregation: <aggregation_2>
            },
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
----
<1> Relationship type to create in the projected graph. It can be the same as the corresponding Neo4j relationship type.
<2> Source Neo4j relationship type as a string. Default: same as the projected type (`<projected_type_1>` here).
<3> Relationship orientation in the projected graph. Allowed values: `NATURAL` (default, same as orientation in the Neo4j graph), `UNDIRECTED` (makes all relationships undirected), `REVERSE` (reverses the orientation for all relationships).
<4> Handling of multiple instances of _all_ the relationship properties associated to the relationship. Allowed values: `NONE` (default), `SINGLE`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`.
<5> Relationship property projection, specified as a single Neo4j relationship property, a list of Neo4j relationship properties, or a projection map. Default: empty map.
<6> Relationship property to create in the projected graph. It can be the same as the corresponding Neo4j relationship property.
<7> Source Neo4j relationship property as a string. Default: same as the projected property (`<projected_prop_1>` here).
<8> Default value if the property is not defined for a relationship. Default: `Double.NaN`.
<9> Handling of multiple instances of a specific relationship property associated to the relationship. Allowed values: `NONE` (default), `SINGLE`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`.

==== Notes

* When specified as a string or a list, the projection does not include any relationship properties.

* The wildcard form does not retain the types on the projected relationships.
Relationship types are useful with algorithms that fully support xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-traits[heterogeneous relationships].
The <<all-labels-example>> example shows how to retain all the relationships for these cases.

* All relationships with any of the specified relationship types, and whose endpoint nodes are included in the <<node-projection-syntax, node projection>>, are projected into the GDS graph.
The `validateRelationships` <<graph-project-native-syntax-configuration, configuration parameter>> controls whether to fail or silently discard relationships whose endpoint nodes are not included in the node projection.

* All specified relationship types and properties must exist in the database.
You can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/#procedure_db_createproperty[`db.createProperty()`] procedure to create a new relationship property without modifying the database.


[[graph-project-examples]]
== Examples

include::partial$/common-usage/examples-empty-db-note.adoc[]

In order to demonstrate the GDS Graph Projection capabilities we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j.
The example graph looks like this:

image::example-graphs/graph-project-example.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20, ratings: [5.0] }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', isbn: 1234, numberOfPages: 310, ratings: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5] }),
  (frankenstein:Book { name: 'Frankenstein', isbn: 4242, price: 19.99 }),

  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin),
  (florentin)-[:READ { numberOfPages: 4 }]->(hobbit),
  (florentin)-[:READ { numberOfPages: 42 }]->(hobbit),
  (adam)-[:READ { numberOfPages: 30 }]->(hobbit),
  (veselin)-[:READ]->(frankenstein)
----

[[graph-project-example-single-label-type]]
=== Simple graph

A simple graph is a graph with only one node label and relationship type, i.e., a monopartite graph.
We are going to start with demonstrating how to load a simple graph by projecting only the `Person` node label and `KNOWS` relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'persons',            // <1>
  'Person',             // <2>
  'KNOWS'               // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipProjection, relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> The name of the graph. Afterwards, `persons` can be used to run algorithms or manage the graph.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with the `Person` label.
<3> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS`.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1,3m,1m"]
|===
| graph     | nodeProjection                         | nodes  | relationshipProjection                                                        | rels
| "persons" | {Person={label="Person", properties={}}} | 3      | {KNOWS={aggregation="DEFAULT", indexInverse=false, orientation="NATURAL", properties={}, type="KNOWS"}} | 2
|===
--

In the example above, we used a short-hand syntax for the node and relationship projection.
The used projections are internally expanded to the full `Map` syntax as shown in the `Results` table.
In addition, we can see the projected in-memory graph contains three `Person` nodes, and the two `KNOWS` relationships.


=== Multi-graph

A multi-graph is a graph with multiple node labels and relationship types.

To project multiple node labels and relationship types, we can adjust the projections as follows:

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndBooks',    // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],   // <2>
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']     // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `personsAndBooks`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS` or `READ`.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | nodeProjection                                                           | nodes  | rels
| "personsAndBooks" | {Book={label="Book", properties={}}, Person={label="Person", properties={}}} | 5      | 6
|===
--

In the example above, we used a short-hand syntax for the node and relationship projection.
The used projections are internally expanded to the full `Map` syntax as shown for the `nodeProjection` in the Results table.
In addition, we can see the projected in-memory graph contains five nodes, and the two relationships.


=== Relationship orientation

By default, relationships are loaded in the same orientation as stored in the Neo4j db.
In GDS, we call this the `NATURAL` orientation.
Additionally, we provide the functionality to load the relationships in the `REVERSE` or even `UNDIRECTED` orientation.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and undirected `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'undirectedKnows',                    // <1>
  'Person',                             // <2>
  {KNOWS: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'}}  // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS knowsProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `undirectedKnows`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with the Person label.
<3> Projects relationships with type `KNOWS` and specifies that they should be `UNDIRECTED` by using the `orientation` parameter.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | knowsProjection                                                                                      | nodes  | rels
| "undirectedKnows" | {KNOWS={aggregation="DEFAULT", indexInverse=false, orientation="UNDIRECTED", properties={}, type="KNOWS"}} | 3      | 4
|===
--

To specify the orientation, we need to write the `relationshipProjection` with the extended Map-syntax.
Projecting the `KNOWS` relationships `UNDIRECTED`, loads each relationship in both directions.
Thus, the `undirectedKnows` graph contains four relationships, twice as many as the `persons` graph in xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc#graph-project-example-single-label-type[Simple graph].


[[node-properties-example]]
=== Node properties

To project node properties, we can either use the `nodeProperties` configuration parameter for shared properties, or extend an individual `nodeProjection` for a specific label.

[role=query-example, group=node-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'graphWithProperties',                                // <1>
  {                                                     // <2>
    Person: {properties: 'age'},                        // <3>
    Book: {properties: {price: {defaultValue: 5.0}}}    // <4>
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ'],                                    // <5>
  {nodeProperties: 'ratings'}                           // <6>
)
YIELD
  graphName, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
RETURN graphName, nodeProjection.Book AS bookProjection, nodes, rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `graphWithProperties`.
<2> Use the expanded node projection syntax.
<3> Projects nodes with the `Person` label and their `age` property.
<4> Projects nodes with the `Book` label and their `price` property. Each `Book` that doesn't have the `price` property will get the `defaultValue` of `5.0`.
<5> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS` or `READ`.
<6> The global configuration, projects node property `rating` on each of the specified labels.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graphName             | bookProjection                                                           | nodes  | rels
| "graphWithProperties" | {label="Book", properties={price={defaultValue=5.0, property="price"}, ratings={defaultValue=null, property="ratings"}}} | 5      | 6
|===
--

The projected `graphWithProperties` graph contains five nodes and six relationships.
In the returned `bookProjection` we can observe, the node properties `price` and `ratings` are loaded for `Books`.

NOTE: GDS currently only supports loading numeric properties.

Further, the `price` property has a default value of `5.0`.
Not every book has a price specified in the example graph.
In the following we check if the price was correctly projected:

[role=query-example, group=node-properties]
--
.Verify the ratings property of Adam in the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Book)
RETURN n.name AS name, gds.util.nodeProperty('graphWithProperties', n, 'price') as price
ORDER BY price
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| name          | price
| "The Hobbit"  | 5.0
| "Frankenstein"| 19.99
|===
--

We can see, that the price was projected with the Hobbit having the default price of 5.0.


=== Relationship properties

Analogous to node properties, we can either use the `relationshipProperties` configuration parameter or extend an individual `relationshipProjection` for a specific type.

[role=query-example, group=rel-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships with `numberOfPages` property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'readWithProperties',                     // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],                       // <2>
  {                                         // <3>
    READ: { properties: "numberOfPages" }   // <4>
  }
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `readWithProperties`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> Use the expanded relationship projection syntax.
<4> Project relationships of type `READ` and their `numberOfPages` property.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph                | readProjection                                                                                                                                                                | nodes  | rels
| "readWithProperties" | {READ={aggregation="DEFAULT", indexInverse=false, orientation="NATURAL", properties={numberOfPages={aggregation="DEFAULT", defaultValue=null, property="numberOfPages"}}, type="READ"}} | 5      | 4
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` were correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=rel-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readWithProperties', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | NaN
|===
--

We can see, that the `numberOfPages` property is loaded. The default property value is `Double.NaN` and could be changed using the Map-Syntax the same as for node properties in xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc#node-properties-example[Node properties].


=== Parallel relationships

Neo4j supports parallel relationships, i.e., multiple relationships between two nodes.
By default, GDS preserves parallel relationships.
For some algorithms, we want the projected graph to contain at most one relationship between two nodes.

We can specify how parallel relationships should be aggregated into a single relationship via the `aggregation` parameter in a relationship projection.

For graphs without relationship properties, we can use the `COUNT` aggregation.
If we do not need the count, we could use the `SINGLE` aggregation.

// special case: COUNT example
[role=query-example, group=count-aggregate]
--

.Stream the relationship property `numberOfReads` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readCount', 'numberOfReads')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfReads

| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 1.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 1.0
|===

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin, and the Hobbit result in `2` numberOfReads.


=== Parallel relationships with properties

For graphs with relationship properties we can also use other aggregations.

[role=query-example, group=sum-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and aggregated `READ` relationships by summing the `numberOfPages`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'readSums',                                                   // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],                                           // <2>
  {READ: {properties: {numberOfPages: {aggregation: 'SUM'}}}}   // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `readSums`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> Project relationships of type `READ`. Aggregation type `SUM` results in a projected `numberOfPages` property with its value being the sum of the `numberOfPages` properties of the parallel relationships.

| graph      | readProjection                                                                                                                                                            | nodes  | rels
| "readSums" | {READ={aggregation="DEFAULT", indexInverse=false, orientation="NATURAL", properties={numberOfPages={aggregation="SUM", defaultValue=null, property="numberOfPages"}}, type="READ"}} | 5      | 3
|===

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=sum-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readSums', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY numberOfPages DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 46.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 0.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit sum up to `46` numberOfReads.


=== Validate relationships flag

As mentioned in the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc#graph-project-native-syntax[syntax section], the `validateRelationships` flag controls whether an error will be raised when attempting to project a relationship where either the source or target node is not present in the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc#node-projection-syntax[node projection].
Note that even if the flag is set to `false` such a relationship will still not be projected but the loading process will not be aborted.

We can simulate such a case with the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc#graph-project-examples[graph present in the Neo4j database]:

--
.Project `READ` and `KNOWS` relationships but only `Person` nodes, with `validateRelationships` set to true:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'danglingRelationships',
  'Person',
  ['READ', 'KNOWS'],
  {
    validateRelationships: true
  }
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
----
org.neo4j.graphdb.QueryExecutionException: Failed to invoke procedure `gds.graph.project`: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to load a relationship because its target-node with id 3 is not part of the node query or projection. To ignore the relationship, set the configuration parameter `validateRelationships` to false.
----
--

We can see that the above query resulted in an exception being thrown.
The exception message will provide information about the specific node id that was missing, which will help debugging underlying problems.


[[all-labels-example]]
=== Graph with all the node labels

You can use the wildcard operator `*` to select all the node labels for the projection.
However, this does not retain the label information on the projected nodes.

Use the `db.labels()` instead to retrieve the list of all the labels, and use it as a value for the `nodeProjection` parameter as in the following example:

[role=query-example]
--
.Project all the labels:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL db.labels() YIELD label
WITH collect(label) AS allLabels
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'allLabelsGraph',
  allLabels,
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']
)
YIELD graphName, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
RETURN *
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1m,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| allLabels          | graphName        | nodeProjection                                                           | nodes  | rels
| ["Person", "Book"] | "allLabelsGraph" | {Book={label="Book", properties={}}, Person={label="Person", properties={}}} | 5      | 6
|===
--

In a similar fashion, you can select all the relationship types for the projection by using `db.relationshipTypes()` as a value for the `relationshipProjection` parameter in place of `['KNOWS', 'READ']`.
