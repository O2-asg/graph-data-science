= End-to-end workflow

A realistic end-to-end workflow typically involves the use of multiple algorithms in a sequence.
This example shows how to create a simple product recommendation engine based on collaborative filtering with the following steps:

* Create a graph of products and customers.
* Compute and add _node embeddings_ to the graph with the xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp.adoc[FastRP] algorithm.
* Compute the similarity score for each pair of customers with the xref:algorithms/knn.adoc[k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)] algorithm based on the node embeddings.
* Find similar customers and recommend products using Cypher queries.


== Create the graph

The following Cypher query creates an example graph of products and customers in the Neo4j database.
The `amount` relationship property represents the average weekly amount of money spent by a customer on a given product.

  (dan:Person {name: 'Dan'}),
  (annie:Person {name: 'Annie'}),
  (matt:Person {name: 'Matt'}),
  (jeff:Person {name: 'Jeff'}),
  (brie:Person {name: 'Brie'}),
  (elsa:Person {name: 'Elsa'}),

  (cookies:Product {name: 'Cookies'}),
  (tomatoes:Product {name: 'Tomatoes'}),
  (cucumber:Product {name: 'Cucumber'}),
  (celery:Product {name: 'Celery'}),
  (kale:Product {name: 'Kale'}),

  (chocolate:Product {name: 'Chocolate'}),

  (dan)-[:BUYS {amount: 2.2}]->(chocolate),

  (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 0.3}]->(celery),

  (elsa)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(chocolate),
  (elsa)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(milk)
----

The graph looks as follows:

image::example-graphs/knn-fastrp.png[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

The next query creates an in-memory graph called `purchases` from the Neo4j graph.
The only difference from the original data is that the orientation of the `:BUYS` relationships is discarded; this is because undirected relationships are the default choice when using the FastRP algorithm.

[source, cypher, role=graph-project-query no-play]
----
MATCH (source:Person)-[r:BUYS]->(target:Product)
RETURN gds.graph.project(
  'purchases',
  source,
  target,
  {
    sourceNodeLabels: labels(source),
    targetNodeLabels: labels(target),
    relationshipType: 'BUYS',
    relationshipProperties: r { .amount }
  },
  { undirectedRelationshipTypes: ['BUYS'] }
)
----


== Add embeddings to the graph

Node embeddings are commonly used to capture topological information from the graph for further processing, for example to be used by another algorithm.

GDS offers several xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/index.adoc[algorithms] to compute embeddings, and FastRP is a good default choice to start with.
Since the embeddings must be available to the kNN algorithm later on, the algorithm must run in xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-mutate[`mutate` mode] to add them to the `purchases` graph.

[role=query-example, group=fastrp-knn]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.fastRP.mutate(  // <1>
  'purchases',  // <2>
  {  // <3>
    embeddingDimension: 4,
    iterationWeights: [0.8, 1, 1, 1],
    relationshipWeightProperty: 'amount',
    randomSeed: 42,
    mutateProperty: 'embedding'
  }
)
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten
----
<1> `gds.fastRP` algorithm running in `mutate` mode.
<2> Name of the projected graph to run the algorithm on and add the new node property to.
<3> Configuration parameters listed in the xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp.adoc#algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-syntax[Syntax section] of the algorithm (`Mutate mode` panel).
Here, the `embeddingDimension` is set to 4 because the graph is small, the `iterationWeights` are chosen empirically to yield sensible results, and the `relationshipWeightProperty` is set to compute weighted averages of the neighboring embeddings.
The `randomSeed` is added to obtain the same results for every run, but is not necessary for the actual computation.
The  `mutateProperty` is the new node property that will contain the node embedding.

You can run the algorithm in `stream` mode as in the xref:getting-started/basic-workflow.adoc[] example by using the corresponding `gds.fastRP.stream` procedure and removing the `mutateProperty` from the configuration parameters.

== Compute and write similarities

With the embeddings available as the new `embedding` node property, you can run the kNN algorithm to compute a similarity score between each pair of nodes.
Run the kNN algorithm in xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-write[`write` mode] to add the `score` relationship to the Neo4j database and use it in Cypher queries.

[role=query-example, group=fastrp-knn]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.knn.write(  // <1>
  'purchases',  // <2>
  {  // <3>
    nodeProperties: ['embedding'],
    nodeLabels: ['Person'],
    topK: 2,
    sampleRate: 1.0,
    deltaThreshold: 0.0,
    randomSeed: 42,
    concurrency: 1,
    writeProperty: 'score',
    writeRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR'
  }
)
YIELD similarityDistribution
RETURN similarityDistribution.mean AS meanSimilarity  // <4>
----
<1> `gds.knn` algorithm running in `write` mode.
<2> Name of the projected graph to run the algorithm on.
The `write` mode does not update the in-memory graph.
<3> Configuration parameters listed in the xref:algorithms/knn.adoc#algorithms-knn-syntax[Syntax section] of the algorithm (`Write mode` panel).
The `nodeLabels` option is set to ['Person'], because we are interested only in `Person`-`Person` similarities and don't want to mix up such similarities with e.g. `Person`-`Product` similarities.
Here, `topK` is set to 2 to select only the two closest targets of a source node, while the `sampleRate` and the `deltaThreshold` are set to 1 and 0 respectively because the graph is small.
The `concurrency` and the `randomSeed` are set to obtain the same results for every run, but are not necessary for the actual computation.
The two `write` properties are used to write a new `:SIMILAR` relationship with a `score` property containing the similarity score between two nodes.
<4> `mean` is one of the fields of the returned `similarityDistribution` map.

[opts="header", caption=, title="Query result", cols="1"]

The mean similarity between nodes is high.
This is because the similarity distribution is computed after selecting the `topK`=2 most similar targets per source node. Moreover, the graph has two clusters of users with quite similar purchases: (Brie, Matt and Annie) and (Elsa, Dan and Jeff). Using a higher value for `topK` would yield a lower average similarity.

If we were to examine Person-Product similariteies, this could be accomplished by using instead xref:alpha-algorithms/filtered-knn.adoc#algorithms-filtered-knn[Filtered K-Nearest Neighbors].


== Find the most similar nodes

After writing the similarity relationships to Neo4j, you can use Cypher to find pairs of customers and rank them by their similarity score.

[role=query-example, group=fastrp-knn]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay , group=fastrp-knn]
----
MATCH (n:Person)-[r:SIMILAR]->(m:Person)
RETURN n.name AS person1, m.name AS person2, r.score AS similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESCENDING, person1, person2
----

.Results
[opts="header", caption=, title="Query result", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person1 | person2 | similarity
| "Dan"   | "Elsa"  | 0.9866833091
| "Elsa"  | "Dan"   | 0.9866833091
| "Brie"  | "Matt"  | 0.9740184546
| "Matt"  | "Brie"  | 0.9740184546
| "Annie" | "Matt"  | 0.9724045992
| "Matt"  | "Annie" | 0.9724045992
| "Annie" | "Brie"  | 0.9154552221
| "Brie"  | "Annie" | 0.9154552221
| "Jeff"  | "Annie" | 0.8667784333
| "Jeff"  | "Matt"  | 0.7591181397
| "Dan"   | "Jeff"  | 0.6660436392
| "Elsa"  | "Jeff"  | 0.5712890029
|===
--

The query result shows that the nodes named "Dan" and "Elsa" are very similar.
In fact, they are both connected to three `:Product` nodes, two of which are the same (the nodes named "Milk" and "Chocolate") and with similar amounts. The "Cookies" Product is only purchased by Dan, but with a lower amount, and it also has a certain degree of similarity to the other products due to its proximity in the graph and partly due to randomness.


== Make recommendations

The basic assumption of collaborative filtering is that products purchased by a customer may be of interest for a similar customer who is not already buying them.
Knowing that "Annie" and "Matt" are similar, you can make product recommendations for each of them with a Cypher query.

[role=query-example, group=fastrp-knn]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay , group=fastrp-knn]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: "Annie"})-->(p1:Product)
WITH collect(p1) AS products
MATCH (:Person {name: "Matt"})-->(p2:Product)
WHERE NOT p2 IN products
RETURN p2.name AS recommendation
----

.Results
[opts="header", caption=, title="Query result", cols="1"]
|===
| recommendation
| "Kale"
|===
--

The query returns the node "Kale" as the one product that "Annie" is already buying but "Matt" does not.
This is the recommended product for "Matt".


== Next steps

Although this is a simplified example, the general workflow is similar for many GDS use cases.

Try a different embedding algorithm or a different configuration for the kNN algorithm.
For example, you can try increasing the `topK` parameter to find more similar customers for each customer.
