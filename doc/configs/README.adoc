# Configuration parameters

The files in this folder contain details about configurations parameters.

These files are meant to be used to partially generate documentation.
In this repository, they are used to incrementally generate the Asciidoc partials that make up the _Syntax_ section of each algorithm.

[NOTE]
====
At this moment, only algorithm configurations are covered.
====

## How to

Run the `process_conf.py` script with `python process_conf.py`.

If there are no changes in the configuration files, running this script will have no effect on Asciidoc files.
Check for any changes by running `git status`.
