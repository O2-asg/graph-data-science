/**
 * This is a fundamental need: a stable, unique identifier to key things to an algorithm.
 * Enums are great because we can switch on them and get completion - no forgetting to map one of them.
 * I have one central authority. But I need to apply the mapping in different contexts,
 * sometimes as part of request processing, sometimes outside request scope. So switch statements in different places,
 * and the safety that I won't forget to map a key.
