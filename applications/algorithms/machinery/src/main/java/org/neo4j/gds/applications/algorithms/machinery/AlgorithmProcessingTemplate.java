/**
 * So, internally, all (pathfinding) algorithms in all modes follow these same steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>You load a graph
 *     <li>You validate the algorithms vs the graph (is it empty, memory usage, etc.)
 *     <li>You establish timings and metrics
 *     <li>YOU CALL THE ACTUAL ALGORITHM! Minor detail...
 *     <li>Next up, mutates or writes, the possible side effect steps
 *     <li>Lastly result rendering
 * </ol>
 *  Result rendering is a whole chapter. It is independent of where call came from, so injected.
 *  It can use any of these parameters:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>graph
 *      <li>graph store
 *      <li>configuration
 *      <li>timings, including side effect steps
 *  </ul>
 *  Injected, plus mode-conditional: it's a wide parameter list...
 *  There is always a result. For streaming, it is duh; for the others it is metadata.
 *  Side effect steps are optional, and they are injected in some sense, but also _selected_.
 *  Because luckily those behaviours are generic enough that you can just select them from a catalogue.
 *  So we _instrument_ with zero or one mode behaviour selected from a catalogue,
 *  and _instrument_ with bespoke result rendering.
