/**
 * This builder supports any type of result you could want to build - famous last words.
 * The idea is, you specialise it for use cases, and the wide parameter lists functions like a union type
 * , so not every implementation will make use of every parameter, but the abstraction covers all.
 * In-layer generic usage includes injecting the Graph, hence it is a parameter to the build method.
 * Out-layer would be injecting custom dependencies as part of a constructor in the implementing class.
 * An example could be a boolean determined at runtime, governing which bits of data to output.
